# DynamicHotkeys

Idea based on this concept: https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/47439-user-defined-dynamic-hotkeys/page-3

Script made using AutoHotkey with the purpose to improve efficiency when using internal software from [redacted]. 

Majority of this code was made for specific use and has no real general application. However, you can take a look still for any related concepts that may be applicable.

TLDR: It masked hard-coded shortcut keys to allow more freedom in chosing personalized shortcuts with some limitations. Major improvement was elimnating the need to mouse over and interact with a GUI sidebar to select attributes by binding it to a shortcut key combination allow faster changes to data.
