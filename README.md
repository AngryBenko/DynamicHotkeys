Idea based on this concept: https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/47439-user-defined-dynamic-hotkeys/page-3

Script made using AutoHotkey with the purpose to improve efficiency when using internal software from [redacted]. 

Majority of this code was made for specific use and has no real general application. However, you take a look still for any related concepts that may be applicable.
